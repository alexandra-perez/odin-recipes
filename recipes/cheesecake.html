<h5>Steps</h5>
<ol>
    <li>
       Preheat the oven. Turn it on to 325¬∞F (163¬∞C) to get it nice and hot. Then grab a 9-inch springform pan to have ready for the next step.
    </li> 
    <li>
        To begin the crust needs to be made! Add the graham crackers to a food processor and then pulse them a few times until they resemble crumbs. Next, add the melted butter and pulse a few more times.
    </li>
    <li>
        Then transfer the pulsed graham cracker crumbs to a 9-inch springform pan and press the mixture firmly into the bottom of the pan using the bottom of a measuring cup or glass to make it easier. Now, place the pan into the preheated oven and bake the crust for 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        While the crust is baking in the oven you can start making the cheesecake batter. Add the room-temperature cream cheese, sugar, flour, and vanilla extract to a large bowl. Then beat the ingredients together with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth and there are no visible lumps. Next, mix in the sour cream.
    </li>
    <li> 
        To complete the batter, add the eggs one at a time and mix them into the batter on low speed until well blended. While doing this you may need to scrape down the sides of the bowl and remix. However, it‚Äôs crucial that you don‚Äôt overmix the batter. Then pour the batter into the baked graham cracker crust.
    </li>
    <li>
        Before you can put the springform pan into a water bath you need to seal the bottom of it with aluminum foil so that the cheesecake can‚Äôt leak out. To do this, cut two long pieces (about 20 inches) of foil and place them on top of each other perpendicularly. Now, place the springform pan on top of the foil, fold up the sides, and crimp to cover the bottom of the pan.
    </li>
    <li>
        To properly bake, you need to make a water bath for the cheesecake. So place the aluminum-wrapped springform pan into a larger roasting pan. Then fill the pan about halfway with boiling water. But make sure it does not go over the foil.
    </li>
    <li>
      To bake, very carefully transfer the cheesecake in the roasting pan to the oven and bake it for 1 hour and 10 minutes. Then check to see if the cheesecake is done by shaking the springform pan. When it‚Äôs ready it will be pretty set, but still slightly jiggle in the middle.  
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the cheesecake is done baking, turn off the oven, but leave the oven door open. Then let the cheesecake cool in the oven until it comes to room temperature. This step is done to prevent cracks from forming on top of the cheesecake. 
    </li>
    <li>
        After the cheesecake has come to room temperature you then need to put it into the fridge for at least 4 hours to set. Overnight is even better. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the cheesecake has fully set, top it with the cherry pie filling. Then slice it and serve it right away to enjoy!
